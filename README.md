This is very rudimentary epub converter, but it will probably get things done. 

Usage:
```python brec.py myepubbook.epub```

The result would be a "bionic_myepubbook.epub" file and a "myepubbook.epub_zip" folder (this one you can delete or explore)


[Bionic Reading](https://bionic-reading.com/) allegedly  helps you read faster and read in general (or at all) if you have some type of struggles in this field.

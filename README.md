This is a rudimentary epub converter to bionic reading, but it will probably get things done. 

Usage:  
```python main_convert.py --epub_path My_Book.epub```

The result would be a **"My_Book_BR.epub"**.


[Bionic Reading](https://bionic-reading.com/) allegedly  helps you read faster and read in general (or at all) if you have some type of struggles in this field.
